## Abstract

This is the repository for preparation and analysis of data obtained from the *Crowdsourced Replication Initiative* ([Breznau, Rinke and Wuttke et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j9qb)) and used as the basis for the paper [Observing Many Researchers Using the Same Data and Hypothesis 
Reveals a Hidden Universe of Uncertainty](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/cd5j9). 

Recently, many researchers independently testing the same hypothesis using the same data, reported tremendous variation in results across scientific disciplines. This variability must derive from differences in each research process. Therefore, observation of these differences should reduce the implied uncertainty. Through a controlled study involving 73 researchers/teams we tested this assumption. Taking all research steps as predictors explains at most 2.6% of total effect size variance, and 10% of the deviance in subjective conclusions. Expertise, prior beliefs and attitudes of researchers explain even less. Ultimately, each model was unique, and as a whole this study provides evidence of a vast universe of research design variability normally hidden from view in the presentation, consumption, and perhaps even creation of scientific results. 

## Workflow

The workflow is provided in a literate programming format, R Markdown notebooks (`.Rmd`), and split across a number of files as described below.
Next to the `.Rmd` files, there are also `.html` files of the same name. The latter contain HTML renderings of the notebooks with the created figures and tables, so that non-R users may view the workflow results more easily with any regular browser software.
For example, the file `01_CRI_Descriptives.Rmd` has a corresponding `01_CRI_Descriptives.html` file in the same folder for easy viewing without the need for running any R code.
Paths in the notebooks are handled with the `here` package and the paths are all relative to the projects root directory (where this README.md file is located).
You can open an interactive environment to explore and execute the analysis yourself based on [Binder](https://mybinder.org) ([Project Jupyter, 2018](https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-4af1f417-011)):

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nbreznau/CRI/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

The runtime environment created for the Binder uses an [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/) snapshot of 2020-03-29 (see file `.binder/runtime.txt`) and installs all required R packages in the file `.binder/install.R`.

The workflow includes a [shinyapp](https://github.com/nbreznau/CRI/tree/master/shiny) that allows users to interact with results using specification curves.

### 0. User Notes

Note that belief in the hypothesis is reverse coded in our analysis and in the shiny app. It has no effect on results, and thus no necessary interpretation. Users should be aware that it is correclty coded in the original survey data, but gets falsely recoded in our workflow. 

We have not added a codebook for subjective conclusions (see below) and users can now access the text of each team's subjective conclusion in the folder '[`expansion_reports`](results/expansion_reports) (where available, as not all teams provided one). 

### 1. Source Code Cleaning

We collected the code from 73 teams and cleaned it for public sharing. This involved qualitative identification of model specifications, ensuring replicability, extracting Average Marginal Effects (AMEs) and redacting any identifying features. The resulting codes are compiled by software type in the sub-folders of this project, ordered by team ID number (in folder [`team_code`](team_code/), and sub-folders: [`team_code_SPSS`](team_code/team_code_SPSS), [`team_code_Stata`](team_code/team_code_Stata), [`team_code_Mplus`](team_code/team_code_Mplus) and [`team_code_R`](team_code/team_code_R)). The code in the [`team_code_R`](team_code/team_code_R)) folder imports the results from all other codes to compile a final joined dataset of effect sizes and confidence interval measures.

Users should be aware that the main data files include team zero, which is the results and model specifications from the study of Brady and Finnigan [(2014)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122413513022) providing a launching point for the CRI; team zero is dropped from our main analyses but provides a point of comparison.

### 2. Data Pre-Preparation

Prior to our main analyses we import data from the Participant Survey including subjective voting on model quality, and the voting during the post-result deliberation. The code for these files (001-003) are contained in the folder [`data_prep`](code/data_prep/). It is not necessary to run these scripts as their output is already saved in the [`data`](data/) folder. 

### 3. Code

Our primary analyses and results are in the [`code`](code/) folder. Many of the results in this folder depend on data preparation done in the [`data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/) folder.

#### Subjective Conclusion Variables Codebook

In the file cri.csv, the different variables used to identify whether the teams concluded "support", "reject" or "not testable" for the hypothesis are potentially confusing. Here is the list of variables and their definitions. Please note that the data contain team "0" which is the original Brady and Finnigan study. Therefore, users will find that the number of cases is higher for models and teams, that that used in the study. We include these here for comparison. 


| **Var name** | **Definition** | **Unit of analysis** |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Hresult` | The team's conclusion separated by hypothesis tests for teams that insisted they tested two, not one hypothesis, the n is higher to account for the 14 teams that submitted two different results for each hypothesis | team-hypothesis-level, n = 89 |
| `Hsupport` | If the team concluded overall support of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hreject` | If the team concluded overall rejection of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hnotest` | If the team concluded that the hypothesis was not testable with these data, 1 = yes | team-level, n=74 |
| `Hmixed` | If the team broke protocol and insisted that there were two different hypotheses being tested, and found different results for each of these hypotheses, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hsupport_stock` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the stock of immigrants in a country led to support of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hsreject_stock` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the stock of immigrants in a country led to rejection of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hnotest_stock` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the stock of immigrants in a country were not sufficient to test the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hsupport_net` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the net migration (flow) of immigrants in a country led to support of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hsreject_net` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the net migration (flow) of immigrants in a country led to rejection of the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hnotest_net` | If the team concluded that their models testing for an effect of the net migration (flow) of immigrants in a country were not sufficient to test the hypothesis, 1 = yes | team-level, n = 74 |
| `Hsup`, `Hrej`, `Hno` | The specific hypothesis test conclusion by the team for those models (it is the variable `Hresult` converted into three dummies), 1 = yes for each dummy | team-hypothesis-level, n = 89 |

### 4. Users may Run All Code

The following scripts run _all_ notebook files in order to check there are no code issues.

```r
source("all.R")
```

## Source Data

The data preparation code is in the sub-folder [`data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/). After the data preparation files, all data files ready for the data analysis are in the [`data`](../master/data/) folder. There are numerous data files because the different participants' codes often require individual special files to run properly. The data files needed to reproduce all of the data analysis are:

| Filename | Description | Source |
| ----| -------|---|
| **MAIN FILES** | Used in Main Analyses 01-07 | |
| `cri.csv` | Main data analysis file, model & team-levels. All specifications coded by the PIs, team test results and researcher characteristics in numeric format | Worked up in [`code/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/) |
| `cri_str.csv` | A string-format only version of `cri.csv` | Worked up in [`code/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/) |
| `cri_team.csv` | A version of `cri_str.csv` aggregated team-level means (N = 89 because 16 teams conducted independent hypothesis tests by 'stock' and 'flow' immigration measures) | Worked up in [`code/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/) |
| `popdf_out.Rdata` |The peer review/deliberation scoring of model specifications as ranked by all participants; excepting non-response | Generated in sub-folder [`CRI/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep/) | Participant survey and Kialo deliberation (see section "Kialo deliberation" in file [`data_prep/001_CRI_Prep_Subj_Votes.Rmd`](code/data_prep/001_CRI_Prep_Subj_Votes.Rmd)) |
|   |        |   |
| **SUB-FILES** | Used in Preparation of Data or App| |
| `Research Design Votes.xlsx` | Based on participant pre-registered designs, plus cursory review of all research designs. Not a fully accurate portrayal of final research designs because, (a) the broad range of specifications not reported in basic research designs and (b) the participant's often deviated from their proposed designs, if only slightly | This is a copy of the actual template (a Google Sheet) used to create the peer review voting system in the Participant Survey | 
| `cri_shiny.csv` | The model-level data needed to run the shiny app | Generated in [`code/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep) |
| `cri_shiny_team.csv` | The team-level data needed to run the shiny app | Generated in [`code/data_prep`](../master/code/data_prep) |
