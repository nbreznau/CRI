However, when replicating everything from scratch (creating the files using their syntaxes), then the results are different. Their previous results were false, they were aware of this and tried to fix it, but they continued to use the variable “percentfb” after submitting their new results and this seems to be the source of the problem.

Had to make some rearrangements in R to get the code to produce the data file for Mplus, seems like some things were added after the code was run but then not re-run. Eventually we got an exact replication in Mplus 8; however, the DVs were not reverse coded to make support = to higher values. Rather than reverse the signs of the effects by hand we recoded the 4 items prior to the analysis. This led to nearly identical results as reversing the signs, but not 100% identical. Maybe the Bayesian routine led to some rounding error.

If PIs understand correctly, the (emprate + foreignpct + socx + netmigpct):year:country command is trying to correct the country-year measures of these level-2 variables. We are worried that this is trying to estimate a within-effect for these variables and this is the source of the problem. There are not enough years to get a within country over-time effect. But we are not experts with brms models, so we are unsure. We are torn between asking the team to change their models (the reality of research where preferred/ideal models are not always possible) and keeping the models as they are (the reality of results, that sometimes they just don't converge or work out). However, given our goals of understanding model specifications and subjective conclusions by the teams, we would hope that the team considers updating the models so that they converge.

Removed the standardization of the immigration variables to allow for comparability across teams.
Signs are reversed in the excel results for the scale models (team48.1.inp), we fixed this by adding the code from their single-item models (team48.2.inp).
Netmig/10 post-hoc to make estimates on a 1 out of 100 scale and comparable with other teams.
NOTE: Individual DVs are standardized. This is possibly the only team doing this, but it likely has an impact on measurement. Consider multiply them back into original metric, but leave for now until team confirms that their code and results are OK, and reconsider later.

Converts data to a long format that includes each response (out of 4) per DV separately. In a way this is like a multinomial logit. Results are then the average effect of immigration on the likelihood of the individual giving a positive response across all six items.

/* This team argued for effects being different by response. Therefore,
we allow their margins to be categorical as well. We consider the 
cutpoints in recreating a single linear effect
Treat four ordered logits as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then estimate the 
difference between the population mean with this coding scheme and 
the predicted population mean based on the likelihood of being in each
category given a 1 point higher value of the indep. variable. This gives 
an approximation of what the overall population mean would be given 
unequal effect intervals. TEam should check that they approve of this tactic.


The alternative to this would be to predict(xb) and have a linear effect,
but our coding here allows the sampled values in the data to change
differently for each parameter given a 1 point change in the

Ran same 24 models with leaving out certain countries, but claimed that leaving out Japan as a ‘special case’ would require a different hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that the first 24 models are the preferred models.
## PI note: It was necessary to add data = na.omit() to all models to replicate
## PI note: 'as.numeric' was added to the socx_oecd variable. This was not present in all models in the team's original code.
## PI note, in order to extract margins efficiently we reorganized the model code (and reordered it to match our internal ordering structure)
Also, Stock and netmig data are missing for 2016, not sure this was intended.

PIs  had to make path changes for their code to run. We used our own path function “pfunc” everywhere they had ‘path’ or other calls to files
Note that the countries and years imported do not all remain in the analysis. 1985 wave is dropped for the models using immigrant stock, and the 2016 wave is dropped for the models using net migration. 
The team reported overall average marginal effects, but this blurs the different effects for the rich democracies (as analyzed by Brady and Finnigan) and all the rest of the countries. We have reorganized the margins commands to present both effects as both are unique effects of immigration variables on different subsets of countries and derive from the team’s idea that effects should be similar across all countries if the hypothesis were true.

There are not enough degrees of freedom for fixed-effects and the three fractionalization variables and to estimate average marginal effects, so we also included Table 4’s models as alternative preferred models but without the interactions. 
lat1 = deserved, lat2 = universal old/sick (2 dimensional latent). Coding was reverse of others (lower values = higher support), so we reversed the signs to make higher values = higher support. 
PI also rescaled netmigpct/5 to put it on a 1-year instead of 5-year scale and thus comparable to all other teams' results.

PI NOTE: Table 1 indicates preferred models (no country-level controls). Also, Brant test and country-specific regressions would make a nice appendix somewhere.
We required a single marginal effect per immigration varaible, but they have four given their categorical response coding. Therefore, we tried ot make a work around. We consider the 
cutpoints in recreating a single linear effect. We treat four ordered logits as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then estimate the difference between the population mean with this coding scheme and the predicted population mean based on the likelihood of being in eachcategory given a 1 point higher value of the indep. variable. This gives an approximation of what the overall population mean would be given unequal effect intervals.
Its not perfect, but it does allow a unique effect per category despite lumping the categories back together at then end. The team should propose if they have any other ideas for recreating a single 'marginal' effect. This effect is necessary to carry out the papers we are writing.

PI NOTE: Used DAGs, this would make a nice addition to an appendix somewhere.
Also that make clear arguments that DV is not linear and therefore effects of foreign-born are not constant over the categories. We estimate margins only on their ordered logits, not their simulated categorical outcome-specific effects because we have no 'obvious' way to do it. We can propose to calculate an overall effect using the following formula, but this takes away the overall ‘categorical’ nature. The team should decide if they want to use the following strategy or have some other strategy, but for the purposes of the CRI we need a single marginal effect per immigration variable (for better or worse). Proposal: To allow their margins to be categorical we could consider tcategories as having continuous values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then estimate the difference between the population mean with this coding scheme and the predicted population mean based on the likelihood of being in each category given a 1 point higher value of the indep. variable. This gives an approximation of what the overall population mean would be given unequal effect intervals, but it reverts back to a continous variable with categorical effects, so perhaps not what the team wants. Probably it is fine to just leave it with the ordered logits to move forward.

Preferred models determined to be m1a through m6a.
PI NOTE: Net migration from the World Bank are not per 1,000 inhabitants, and dividing by 1,000 does not create this value. Thus, the team seems to have made a mistake here. The World Bank variable has to be divided by the actual population to generate the appropriate values. Also, the World Bank offers 5-year estimates, so they also have to be divided by 5. PIs fixed this.
Team should be aware that by measuring net migration (as a % of the population) all 6 coefficients become significant and negative. Team should please decide if (A) they had intended to measure net migration (and thus accept our recode of the variable), and (B) if they want to change their conclusion about the hypothesis after having the 'correct' measure in their models.

PI NOTE: Consider putting Approach 2 (analyses by groups) in an appendix.
PIs replaced mfx commands by margins,dydx; got slightly different results. But this does not seem to be due to the mfx command, there were many places in the code where we had to make adjustments to get it to run. Team should decide if they accept our adjustments, otherwise they have to submit new code that runs and produces AMEs.
The second set of models uses “reg” but are coded as “ml_fe” because everything is differenced prior to running, so the estimator is coded “ols” but the model only identifies within-variance. 49-96 = diif-in-diff models (ml_fe in our coding scheme).

PI rescaled netmigpct2/10 (it is mignet_un) to put it on a 1 out of 100 scale and make it comparable to all other teams.
This team has effects being different by categorical response. Therefore, categorical marginal effects, unique per DV category. We try to allow their margins to be ‘categorical’ as well. We consider the cutpoints in recreating a single linear effect. We treat four ordered logits as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then estimate the difference between the population mean with this coding scheme and the predicted population mean based on the likelihood of being in eachcategory given a 1 point higher value of the indep. variable. This gives an approximation of what the overall population mean would be given unequal effect intervals. Not perfect, but all we could think of because we must have a single ‘marginal’ effect for each immigraiton variable given our research design. Team should say if they have any other alternative ideas.
